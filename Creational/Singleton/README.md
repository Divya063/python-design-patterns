A Singleton pattern in python is a design pattern that allows you to create just one instance of a class, throughout the lifetime of a program. Using a singleton pattern has many benefits. A few of them are:

To limit concurrent access to a shared resource.
To create a global point of access for a resource.
To create just one instance of a class, throughout the lifetime of a program.
