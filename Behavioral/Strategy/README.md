The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows clients to choose an appropriate algorithm from a family of algorithms without altering their structures. The Strategy pattern promotes code reusability and flexibility, as it enables you to change the behavior of a class or method at runtime by swapping different strategies.
