The Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is used to implement distributed event handling systems, in which a subject (the publisher or observable) maintains a list of its dependents (subscribers or observers) and notifies them of state changes.
