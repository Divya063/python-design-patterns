Adapter design pattern is used to connect interfaces which are not compatible with each other. This situation usually arises when legacy code needs to be integrated with a new module. 

- To enable old APIs to work with new refactored ones.
- To allow an object to cooperate with a class that has an incompatible interface.
- To reuse the existing functionality of classes.
